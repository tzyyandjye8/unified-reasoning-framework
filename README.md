# Unified Reasoning Framework

This project is an open-source initiative to improve the reasoning quality of language models across languages, domains, and use cases by unifying prompt design, data collection, and logic validation standards.

## Goals

- Promote use of first-hand, up-to-date sources in data gathering
- Establish prompt templates for different reasoning domains (e.g., economics, faith, linguistics)
- Enable consistent logic and transparency across languages
- Encourage contributions from diverse users

## Structure

- `templates/`: Modular prompt templates
- `examples/`: Test prompts and outputs
- `tests/`: Validation tests for logic quality (WIP)
